### Hi there 👋

My name is Calin Petrut and i am a full stack developer, currently in progress of graduating General Assembly bootcamp, 
working with Javascript, jQuery, HTML5, CSS3, NodeJS and Express. My previous career was in hospitality: I have a college degree in
International Hotel Business Management. I've been in interships in Belgium, Spain and USA. This journey took me from bartending 
to all departments of a hotel, ending up managing a Hilton hotel restaurant in Alexandria to Assistant Food&Beverage Director and Events Manager,
for the Hilton hotel in my hometown in Romania. I was always a creative type of person which I've tried to implement in all aspects of my hospitality career.

While I've loved everywhere I've worked, I trully feel like entering the coding world is something that i was always
passioned about. I love traveling, Game of Thrones, music, people and movies. Stop by and say hi!
